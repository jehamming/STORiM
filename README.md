# STORiM
Story based instant messaging

A server (and client(s)!) for a new way of communication: Whatsapp features combined with MOO features. 
With STORIM you can connect to a Server, walk through rooms (by text or visually (2D)) and chat with others using VERBS.

Verb examples : 
command>la This is fun!
result>You Laugh, "This is fun!"

command>ex You can create your own verbs!
result>You explain, "You can create your own verbs!"



STORIM is Inspired by LambdaMOO (rooms, things, verbs) and Whatsapp
